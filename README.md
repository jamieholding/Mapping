# Mapping

Welcome to the home of UK Shape Files! I have found that I often want a fairly common shape file so have been storing them every time I use one.

 Names are self explanatory, sources are:
* https://data.gov.uk/dataset/2aa6727d-c5f0-462a-a367-904c750bbb34/nuts-level-1-january-2018-full-clipped-boundaries-in-the-united-kingdom
* https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts

The reason for using "Simplified" and "Semi-simplified" are because the originals are large which can cause problems. You can view the maps themselves by clicking the links.
